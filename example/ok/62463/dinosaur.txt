===Brachiosaurus===

   Brachiosaurus is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived in North America during the Late Jurassic, about 154-150 million years ago. The generic name is Greek for "arm lizard", in reference to its proportionately long arms, and the specific name means "deep chest". Brachiosaurus is estimated to have been between 18-21 meters long; weight estimates range from 28.3-58 metric tons. It's among the most iconic and initially thought to be one of the largest dinosaurs.
