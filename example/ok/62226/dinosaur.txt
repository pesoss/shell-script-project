My favorite dinosaur is brachiosaurus. It had a bump on its head so it could breathe under water to get away from Tyrannosaurus rex. Brachiosaurus is my favorite dinosaur because if I were a dinosaur, I would like to be it because there was lots of water around that it could go into to get away from its enemies.
