I used the command cd to navigate through the filesystem. I used the command cp to copy the homework archive to my home directory. I used the command tar -xf to extract the archive. I used the command echo with redirection of the output to put the name of the dinosaur in the file. I used the command cat to read the content of the file. I used the command tar -cJf to archive and compress the directory. I used the website linuxize.com to get information about the usage of the tar command.
