I created a new directory homework using mkdir
I copied the archive using cp
I extracted the content of the archive using tar
I opened the 66666 directory using cd
Then opened the problem.txt file to see the problem
After that i wrote my favourite dinosaur in the file using echo command
Finally I wrote down the process of working in this file using echo command
For this homework I used the materials given from the course and a website called dev.to
