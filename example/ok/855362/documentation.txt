I downloaded and unzipped the archive from moodle. 
Renamed it to match my faculty number.                                         
Using WinSCP copied the directory to the remote file system on astero.          
Opened the directory using cd 855362.                                           
Using cat problem.txt I opened the problem.txt file containing the 
instructions for the task.                                                                   
Using echo Oviraptor 1>dinosaur.txt I wrote what my favourite dinosaur 
is and redirected the output of echo into the dinosaur.txt file 
[q-files.com/prehistoric/dinosaur-species for help with the choice]
