I copied the 66666.tar.xz archive from /srv/homeworks/0/66666.tar.xz using the   "cp" command into my own directory /home/students/s62233. Then i extracted it  using the tar -xf command, which i saw online at cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-extract-tar-xz-files-in-linux-and-unzip-all-files. Then i renamed the new directory  66666 to 62233 using mv command. And  lastly i used cat > filename to describe my favorite dinosaur and the same command to fill the documentation.txt file.
