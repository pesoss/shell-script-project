I started with copying the file to my directory and decomresing with unxz and unarchiving using tar -xf. Then i renamed the file to 62551 using mv new name old name . After which i wrote in file dinasaur.txt the dinasaur i chose, after a breaf google search about ugly dinasaurs and stoping on this one. Now im writing this documentation, after which i will archive it using tar -cf filename files and commpress it using xz file name and upload it.
